# *YAP WARS*  

## *Getting Started*  
*Yap Wars App*  
An AI-powered application for fact-checking, grammar correction, toxicity detection, and more!  

### *Project Overview*  
Yap Wars is designed to enhance the accuracy, readability, and credibility of written content. It integrates advanced AI models for:
- Fact verification  
- Grammar checking  
- Toxicity detection  
- Vocabulary complexity analysis  
- Relevance assessment  

Built using *Flutter, our app provides a seamless user experience, connecting the **AI-powered backend* with an intuitive *frontend interface* to deliver real-time content analysis.

## *Features & Functionality*  

### *1. Fact Check & Verification*  
*API Used → OpenAI GPT-4o*  
- Our AI cross-references user-provided content with credible sources to validate facts and detect misinformation.  
- Real-time verification helps users ensure the authenticity of their information.  

### *2. Grammar & Syntax Check*  
*Model Used → Pretrained NLP Model*  
- Automatically detects and corrects grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and awkward phrasing.  
- Enhances clarity, making the text more readable and professional.  

### *3. Toxicity & Abuse Detection*  
*Model Used → Pretrained Model for Toxicity Analysis*  
- Identifies and filters out toxic, abusive, or offensive content.  
- Useful for moderating user-generated content in platforms like forums and chat apps.  

### *4. Structure & Coherence Analysis*  
*Model Used → A heavily fine-tuned base model*  
- Evaluates logical flow, paragraph organization, and content coherence.  
- Ensures that the text follows structured and professional writing standards.  

### *5. Vocabulary Complexity Analysis*  
*Functionality*  
- Detects word complexity levels and suggests simpler alternatives for better readability.  
- Helps users tailor their writing based on target audience comprehension.  

### *6. Relevance to the Topic*  
*AI Evaluation*  
- Measures content alignment with the intended topic.  
- Useful for bloggers, journalists, and students to ensure their content stays on track.

## *Tech Stack*  

### *Frontend - Flutter*  
- Flutter is used to create a cross-platform mobile and web application with an elegant UI/UX.  

### *Backend - AI & API Integration*  
Technologies Used:  
- *Dart (for Flutter)* → Handles frontend logic.  
- *Flask (for backend API handling)* → Connects AI models with the app.  
- *OpenAI GPT-4o API* → Handles fact-checking and content verification.  
- *Pretrained NLP Models* → Used for grammar, toxicity, and structure analysis.
